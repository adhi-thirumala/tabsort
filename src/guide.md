# Welcome to Tabsort
The tool for solving ordinal judge preferences in national circuit debate.
## Why?
Doing ordinal prefs is hard and annoying. It's a fairly daunting task to order anywhere from 10s to 100s of judges for a given debate tournament.
TabSort hopes to make this easier.
## How?
Well, we've actually created algorithms over the years to put things in order. We call them sorting algorithms.
Here, we've implemented what is known as Merge-Insertion sort (or the Ford-Johnson algorithm). You can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge-insertion_sort), but long story short, it seeks to minimize comparisons.
By extension, that decreases cognitive load on you, the theoretical coach or debater doing their prefs for the TOC. By splitting up the insurmountable task of ordinal preferences into many small managable tasks, we hope to make this process easier.

# Guide
## Obtaining the list of judges
First, go to tabroom.com. There are two ways to get the list of judges. They both produce slightly different files when downloaded, but the program should work all the same. The easiest way is to go to the tournament that you want to do preferences for and click on the "Judges" tab. Then, click on the button with the Excel-esque logo. This should download a file ending in ```.csv``` If you get a file that ends in ```.pdf```, you have the wrong file. This will download a CSV file with the list of judges. 
## Actually sorting
Go to the sorting page by clicking on the button in the navigation bar or on the main page. Upload the file by either dragging and dropping it or clicking on the button and selecting the file. The program will then give you a list of comparisons to make. Keep going until there are no more comparisons to make.
## Seeing the results
Once you are done, you can see the results of your sort. At the top of the website, there will be a switch that allwos you to either see the judges in the order you sorted them or in alphabetical order. You can also download the list of judges in either order as well to save for future use.
## Inputting into Tabroom
The best way of inputting these preferences into Tabroom is to sort alphabetically and either look at the website or download the csv file while sorting the judges on Tabroom alphabetically by frst name as well. Then you can quickly input ranking numbers into the system.
