# TabSort
## Description
This is a very early version of a tool that I have in mind. It allows you to run a program that functionally merge sorts a CSV of tabroom judges. Every time it makes a comparison, it asks the user to determine which judge is "better". At the end, your judges will be perfectly sorted. The CSV file to use with this is the "Prefs Sheet" that can be downloaded on the website where one does prefs and rankings. Eventually this will become a website, but I am too bored right now.

## Usage
Download from Releases or run yourself with `python tabsort.py`. Then provide a path to the file that you want to use. At the end, it will spit out a list of every judge and their ordinal ranking. The easiest way to do this is to then sort the list of judges that tabroom gives you alphabetically by first name on the website. The program wil output a list alphabetically sorted and you can input the positions easily into the website.
