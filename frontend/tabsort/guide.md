# Welcome to Tabsort
## Why?
Doing ordinal prefs is hard and annoying. It's a fairly daunting task to order anywhere from 10s to 100s of judges for a given debate tournament.
TabSort hopes to make this easier.
## How?
Well, we've actually created algorithms over the years to put things in order. We call them sorting algorithms.
Here, we've implemented what is known as Merge-Insertion sort (or the Ford-Johnson algorithm).
